                    Twenty seconds were all that was left and Richard could hear each one tick by. 
                    Fifteen seconds now remained and the panic began to fully set in. Ten seconds 
                    and he wasn't sure he had enough time. Five seconds, four, three, two, one...
                    They say you only come to peace with yourself when you know yourself better than those 
                    around you. Derick knew nothing about this. He thought he had found peace but this was 
                    an illusion as he was about to find out with an unexpected occurrence that he actually 
                    knew nothing about himself.

                    It was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had actually given him 
                    life. While everyone around him was in tears and upset, he actually felt more at ease. The doctor 
                    said it would be less than a year. That gave him a year to live, something he'd failed to do with 
                    his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then.
